    <div class="separator"></div>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;">Budding actors take note! This category involves acting out short "cuttings" from published plays, novels, short stories, and poems. You’re the director casting agent, and actor(s)!  You can perform as one or more characters, and can even sing if you want. Most interp events are performed solo, but this is the only category besides debate that also offers a partner event (Duo). No props, costumes, scenery, or other stage materials are ever allowed. Time limit: 10 minute max, no minimum time, but 8:30+ is suggested.</h4>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;">As you are writing your pieces, you must keep a copy of all information used while researching the topic, regardless of whether or not it is quoted material.  These must be included in your MLA Works Cited page.  Note that any script turned in without proper MLA format will not be allowed to compete.</h4>
