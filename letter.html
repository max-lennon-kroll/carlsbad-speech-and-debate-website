    <h2>Parent Welcome Letter</h2>
    <h4>Dear Parents,<br><br>
    <b>We are delighted to welcome your student to the Carlsbad Speech and Debate team!</b> Forensics, otherwise known as competitive speech, is an excellent co-curricular activity. Students who participate in these events are challenged to think critically, research extensively, organize ideas and information, and perform. Beyond just the basic educational skills students learn to develop, students also develop self-confidence, poise, fluent thought and the art of articulating that thought; not to mention that they have a ton of fun!<br><br>The Carlsbad Speech and Debate team offers a wide range of interests from four types of debate (Policy, Parliamentary, Public Forum and Lincoln Douglas) as well as Student Congress, and twelve different individual speech events. We attend more than a dozen league tournaments and invitational tournaments. In addition we are a member of the <a href="https://www.speechanddebate.org/">National Speech and Debate Association</a>, an academic honor society recognized by colleges and universities across the nation. This is the team to be on for sure!<br></h4>
    <h4>So, while your kids are competing, we are hoping to make this a family affair!</h4>
    <h4>You are an integral part of our world …Yep, you got it …. We really do need you!</h4>
    <h4>Students are required to provide a judge for the tournaments in which they compete. Usually judges are the student’s parents, but older siblings (two years beyond high school age) , teachers, other friends, relatives or complete strangers often fill in on their behalf!  We will train the judges, feed all volunteers and shower them with praise and gratitude.<br></h4>
    <h4><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FVyxc6YWnXNefCDeTzQlkZtwGYpofQecWIYQ-sxcDYM/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank">Here is the schedule for the year.</a><br><b>We do hope that by having the schedule in advance, it will make it easier for you to plan and arrange a time for the team – we really do need you!</b></h4>
    <h4>When you judge, you are going to need a computer, as everything that we do is by a site called “Tabroom” … and you are going to need to make an account, that is how we can sign you up.<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16U50znmDCQKIaeBFVjMfGj8YZVCU2vvyOX1GFZS8jfE/edit?usp=sharing">Here is a presentation to help you set that account up!</a></h4>
    <h4>Judging times vary; we typically ask that you <b>judge two to three rounds per tournament.</b> As per the time, that means judging <b>"mornings" from either 7:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. or "afternoons" from 12:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.</b> (Note: We do approximate the time as we are at the mercy of the tournament.)</h4>
    <h4>Although some parents find judging intimidating the first time, we think that you’ll enjoy the experience. However, to ease your mind we also will be having a <b>parent meeting on August 27th with the Boosters</b> which will better acquaint you with the workings of Speech and Debate, fundraising, team rules, needs and expectations.</h4>
    <h4>If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me, I will be happy to answer them! However, text and call is often easier than email, so please do not hesitate to use all mediums to reach me … my cell is <b>559.905.8695</b></h4>
    <h4>We have a great team this year, and we are really looking forward to working with you and your student!</h4>
